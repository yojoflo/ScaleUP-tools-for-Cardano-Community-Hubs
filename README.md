# ScaleUP-tools-for-Cardano-Community-Hubs
The Cardano community is pioneering a new collaborative mindset. A new way of working together. A new way of solving vexing problems. The future has arrived, the challenge is to evenly distribute it; To paraphrase William Gibson[13].

To see opportunity and act upon it requires an entrepreneurial mindset. Entrepreneurs are everywhere. Tech Entrepreneurs, Impact Entrepreneurs, Interpenuers. They are driven by their beliefs, principles and values. They see the world from a local perspective, as it could be.

To develop the entrepreneurial mindset and turn ideas into sustainable projects and ventures, community-led hubs become places entrepreneurs can build knowledge, share information, connect, learn about and support each other. They can evenly distribute the Cardano future.
## Current problems and limitations

To stay relevant and sustain their operations Local Hubs need to develop engaging programmes of events, workshops, and networking opportunities. However, as a newly emerging field that blends entrepreneurship, blockchains, token engineering, culture, governance and Cardano it is hard to find expertise to instigate, shape, host and run these events. When language and cultural barriers are factored in, reaching entrepreneurs becomes even more difficult.

Few entrepreneurs are aware of the opportunities, the technical and economic benefits or the Project Catalyst community governance of Cardano; Nor is there a full understanding of how to apply Cardano technology to micro, small and medium businesses, or startups who have the vision to scale. We need local hubs to distribute that knowledge, to make Cardano a viable option for solving market needs. The lack of available expertise restricts a hub's ability to broadcast the potential uses of Cardano's technology to the fullest. We want to change that.


## Our Solution

Co-design Canvas, Card deck & Calculator tools for hubs that are easy to explain, customise & share offline for designing blockchain ventures.

Prototype the first Cardano Business Design Canvas and associated toolkit starting with a card deck, and calculator. An engaging pack of resources that can be used at local hubs, start-up events and hackathons. These artefacts kick-start a customisable open-source set of business model co-design tools that help entrepreneurs understand and explore how to apply Cardano's technology. They create a shared community language for the greater good.

Using these resources as facilitation tools will help people understand each other and the opportunities the Cardano platform can provide them in their particular problem/solution space. They aid the process of blending worldview, information, and expertise. They focus effort on experience-based learning by providing a fun way for people to analyse, communicate, and decide.

We have extensively used the Lean Startup Canvas[1] as a facilitation artefact in hundreds of Start Weekends[2] held across New Zealand. The Cardano Business Design Toolkit is inspired by and modelled after the Platform Design Toolkit[3]. A synthesis of the Business Model Generation[4], Customer Development[5], Design Thinking[6], and Wardley Mapping[7] applied to blockchain business models. The Platform Design Toolkit is inspired by analytical tools like Lean Startup Canvas.

### The initial toolkit will include three components:

- [ ] Cardano Business Design Canvas: A set of co-design templates and associated guides that help facilitate team discussion and analysis of token business models.
- [ ] Blockchain Economy Card Deck: A set of design patterns and methods presented as cards that prompt discussion and investigation [8].
- [ ] Startup Cost Calculator: A web-based tool to help entrepreneurs budget for the costs of setting up and running a new venture [9].

Our first test deployment of the Cardano Business Design Toolkit will be in Vietnam and Indonesia! Working with the Catalyst Eastern Townhall[10] to deliver their Cardano StartUp Week in February 2022. From there we hope to iterate and refine the toolkit and translate it into more languages.

## What comes next
More advanced facilitation artefacts in the future will include;

A Token Economy Simulator - easy to use web-based simulator for designing the parameters of a token economic system and its costs.
Integration of Social Simulations[11] and Games[12] into the toolkit that helps teams understand the complexity and trade-offs in the designs by playing games.
